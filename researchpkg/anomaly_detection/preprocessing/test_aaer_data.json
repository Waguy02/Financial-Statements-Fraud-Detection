Solely for the \npurpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on be half of the \nCommission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over her  and the subject matter of \nthese proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.B.3 below, which are admitted, \nRespondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (\u201cOrder\u201d), as set forth bel ow.   \n \nIII. \n \n On the basis of this Order and Respondent\u2019s Offer, the Commission finds that : \n \n 1. Li, age 39, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the \nState of North Carolina.  She served as Chief Financial Officer of Keyuan  Petrochemicals, Inc.  \n(\u201cKeyuan\u201d) from May 2010 until her  resignation  in October 2011.  \n  2. Keyuan was, at all relevant times, a Nevada  corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in Ningbo, China .  Keyuan is a manufacturer and supplier of petrochemica l products. At \nall relevant times, Keyuan \u2019 s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to \nSection 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and traded on the NASDAQ Stock  Market  LLC . \n  3. On February 28, 2013, the Commis sion filed a complaint against Li in \nSEC v. \nKeyuan Petrochemicals, Inc., Civil Action No. 13- cv-00263 (D.D.C.) .  On July 2, 2013, the court \nentered an order permanently enjoining Li, by consent, from future violations of Section 13(b)(5)  \nof the Exchange Ac t and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of \nthe Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b -20 and 13a -13 thereunder.  Li was also ordered \nto pay a $25,000 civil money penalty.  \n \n4. The Commission\u2019s complaint alleged, among oth er things, that between May  \n2010 and January 2011, Keyuan failed to disclose material related party transactions between and among the company and its chief executive officer and controlling shareholders as well as entities controlled by or affiliated with those persons. The related party transactions to ok the \nform of loan guarantees, purchases of raw materials, sales of products, and short term cash transfers for financing purposes. Li, who was hired to ensure the company\u2019s compliance with U.S. GAAP and oversee the SEC reporting process, received informa tion indicating that the \ncompany was engaged in certain related party transactions in the form of loan guarantees.  Li also encountered red flags that should have alerted her that the company was not properly identifying or disclosing certain related party  transactions.  Despite such knowledge, Li signed \noff on registration statements and periodic reports filed between May 2010 and January 2011 that \n \n3 \n failed to disclose material related party transactions, as required by U.S. GAAP and/or \nCommission regulation s.   \nIV. \n \n In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest \nto impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent \u2019s Offer.  \n  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that : \n \n A. Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, Li is suspended \nfrom appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.    \n \n B. After two  years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the \nCommission consider her  reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the \nChief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:  \n             1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or \nreview, of any public  company\u2019s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such \nan application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent\u2019s work in her practice before the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public compa ny \nfor which she works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as she practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or  \n      \n  2.    an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the \nCommission that:  \n                 (a) Responde nt, or the public accounting firm with which she is \nassociated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) in accordance with the Sarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;  \n    (b) Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which \nshe is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the respondent\u2019s or the firm\u2019s quality control system that would indica te that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision;  \n    (c) Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and \nhas complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and  \n    (d) Respondent acknowledges her responsibility, as long as \nRespondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.   \n      \n \n4 \n C. The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume appearing \nor practicing before the Commission provided that  her state CPA license is current and she has \nresolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, \nif state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission\u2019s review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondent\u2019s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before t he \nCommission.  \n  By the Commission.  \n          Elizabeth M. Murphy  \n       Secretary  \n \n"
